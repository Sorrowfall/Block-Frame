# Block Frame

Generate Minecraft-styled backgrounds from block textures.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have python installed.

After, open your terminal in the containing folder and run:

`blockframe -t textureName.png`

The default `textureName.png` value that you can use is `dirt.png`, as it is included with the script.

> Run `blockframe --help` to see the more advanced options.
